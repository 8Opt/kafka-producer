# kafka-producer


This component of the Kafka Learning Project is responsible for producing and sending frames to the Kafka cluster. It acts as the data source for the Kafka ecosystem, enabling real-time data processing and analysis.

## Overview

The Kafka Producer is designed to:

- Read frames from a specified source.
- Serialize the frames for transmission.
- Send the serialized frames to designated Kafka topics within the cluster.

## Features

- **Frame Reading**: Efficiently reads frames from various sources.
- **Serialization**: Converts frames into a format suitable for Kafka transmission.
- **High Throughput**: Optimized for sending large volumes of data quickly and reliably.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Apache Kafka must be installed and running.
- Ensure the Kafka cluster is properly configured and accessible.

### Configuration

- Configure the producer settings in `config.json`:
  - Specify the Kafka broker addresses.
  - Set the target Kafka topics for frame transmission.
